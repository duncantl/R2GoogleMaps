Note:  This is very different from the RgoogleDocs package.
  That allows R users to fetch images of maps from Google
  and to display them in an R graphics device. This 
  allows us to use R to create code that will display
  data in a Web browser on top of Google Maps. So this
  works in the opposite "direction", exporting data from
  R to Google Maps. The RgoogleDocs package imports
  data from Google Maps to R.
